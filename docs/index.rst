Features
--------

* Plugin â€” *Harpseal* is built upon a plugin system which allows support for new plugin to be easily created and added. It's quite easy in fact as you can see in this documentation. even you don't know anything about Harpseal structures.

* HTTP API - JSON/JSONP (callback)

  * It is possible to create a cluster monitoring system with **super simple** HTTP API.

  * As I've written above, even you can get jsonp callback mechanism; the more easily, you can create it with **Javascript** only.

* Light-weighted: with event-driven. *Harpseal* requires a lower memory footprint than many of system resource monitoring tools.

* Free. *Harpseal* is totally free to use even for commercial purposes.

* Super easy to install: it's super easy to install and set up *Harpseal* server on your Debian-based linux distros because it's already ready.
